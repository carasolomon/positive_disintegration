# Positive Disintegration Simulator

## Description

The Positive Disintegration Simulator is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool that guides users through a series of questions to assess their stage of personal development based on the theory of positive disintegration. This theory describes a process of psychological growth and personal transformation. Users can respond to the questions and receive personalized guidance based on their stage.

## Features

- **Interactive Questionnaire:** Users are prompted with a series of questions that map to different stages of personal growth.
- **Customized Guidance:** Based on user responses, the program offers tailored advice to guide further personal development.
- **Graphical Interface:** Utilizes a user-friendly graphical interface, making the assessment accessible and engaging.

## How to Run

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure that you have Python (3.x or above) installed on your system.
2. **Clone or Download the Repository:** If the code is hosted on a platform like GitHub, clone or download the repository to your local system.
3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:** Open a command-line interface (CLI) or terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the `positive_disintegration.py` file.
4. **Run the Program:** Execute the following command to launch the simulator:

   ```bash
   python positive_disintegration.py
   ```

   Alternatively, you can open the file using an IDE like Visual Studio Code and run the program from there.

5. **Follow the Instructions:** The program will open a window with instructions and questions. Respond to each question by selecting either "Yes" or "No," then click the "Calculate My Stage" button to see your results.

## Notes

- The program utilizes the Tkinter library for the GUI. If you encounter any issues with the graphical interface, please ensure that Tkinter is properly installed on your system.
- The questions and stages are inspired by the theory of positive disintegration and may provide insights into personal growth, but this simulator is intended for entertainment and exploration rather than professional psychological assessment.
